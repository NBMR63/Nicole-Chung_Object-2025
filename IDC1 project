Idea: 
  - Water bottles that yell at you when you don't drink enough water per day. 

Thought progress: 
  - Essential functions: 
    - Measures leftover water
    - Compare the progress of water consumption every day
      - print out different results based on the True/False, whether it fulfilled the reqirements

  - Subessential functions: 
    - Detect whether the water bottle is upright and only measure the leftover water when it's upright
    - Resets the process every day
    - Check the water consumption progress 4 times a day
