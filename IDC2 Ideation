Idea: 
  My IDC1 was a water bottle that yells at me when I do not drink enough water. 
  For IDC2, instead of attaching the device on the water bottle itself, 
  I'm making a external station that you can put the water bottle on to measure the remaining water inside. 
  
  I'm planning to add buttons to choose between different settings, so I can measure different water bottles. 
  I can indicate whether the water bottle was refilled through some kind of trigger like another button. 
  It will be a puck shaped base that can be portable enough to carry around, or a station. 
  The station will looks like a coffee port, that will be in place where I most likely to forget drinking. 
  
  It's going to turn the device on when the water bottle is placed on the base, so it save some energy. 
  Then it will print message based on the weight. And it can also tell how much more water is needed when you press another button. 

Modules I'll use: 
  - LCD monitor with 4 wire
    - I used normal wire on LCD monitor, but I need more simplified on so I can make this device compact as possible
  - Modular buttons
    - ones that are attached next to each other or on a circuit together already so I can save space? (maybe)
  - Some sort of trigger(switch)
    - to control arduino turning on and off based on there's water botton on top of the device or not to save energy(battery)
