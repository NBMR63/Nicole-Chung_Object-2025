Thought process: 
    I wanted to make an enclosure that matches the color of the light, which made me think of a stone lantern in an Asian landscape for the 3d Print. 
    For the laser print portion, I just wanted to make a box that could open on the bottom, so it is easy to remove the circuit.

Reflection: 
    For the 3d Print portion, 
    I think I could've made the lantern bigger and moved the sockets to the bottom part, 
    So the print would have been able to print without being completely flipped on its side. 
    It failed so many times that it made me cry a little bit.

    For the laser print portion, 
    I could've used a different glue or reduced the tolerance to make it more sophisticated.
    Also needed to recalculate the size and length of the button hole, so it doesn't wobble so much.
